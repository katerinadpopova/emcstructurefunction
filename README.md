# emcstructurefunction
Here we add the following resources:
1) raw fcs files for the fluorescent reporter analysis of the EMC
2) manifests with EMC mutation identity and name of fcs files
3) processing pipelines for the analysis
4) raw Sanger sequencing files validating the identity of mutant EMC subunits
5) mass spectrometry raw data
